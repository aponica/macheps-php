Please [contact us](https://aponica.com/contact/) if you believe this package
is missing important functionality that you'd like to provide.

Under the covers, the code is **heavily commented** and uses a form of
[Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) 
for data type guidance. If you submit a pull request, please try to maintain
the (admittedly unusual) coding style, which is the product of many decades
of programming experience.
